## Parsing

- David: I took part in overall parsing of the raw appointment data, and weather data for use in database and in machine learning (parsing.py). I integrated and documented the ICD9 parsing functoinality that Talia provided. I had an early start on parsing such that different learning algorithmss could be evaluated on the commond grounds for the midterm projects, by using the same set of features, folds, and training and test data. In the process I initiated the Git repository, and took a role in managing it. 

- Talia: Traffic research
ICD9 background research and grouping by umbrella term
ICD9_archive folder
parsing_icd9.py
Reviewed Harvey et al. paper and presented key findings
Largely created group powerpoint presentation (i.e. future direction slides) and integrated slides

## Database

## Machine learning

- Jen: was a great leader. Made things happen. Brought me brownies and cookies as well.

## Interface

- Akashya: Did a great visualization and demo of

- Chrysostomos: how COOL
