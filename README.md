## Parsing

- David: Please see Parsing.ipynb to see an example of parsing. I took part in overall parsing of the raw appointment data, and weather data for use in database and in machine learning (parsing.py). I integrated and documented the ICD9 parsing functoinality that Talia provided. I had an early start on parsing such that different learning algorithmss could be evaluated on the commond grounds for the midterm projects, by using the same set of features, folds, and training and test data. In the process I initiated the Git repository, and took a role in managing it. 

- Talia: 
  -Traffic research
  -ICD9 background research and grouping by umbrella term
  -ICD9_archive folder
  -parsing_icd9.py
  -Reviewed Harvey et al. paper and presented key findings
  -Largely created group powerpoint presentation (i.e. future direction slides) and integrated slides

## Database

- Lavanya: Explored the unknowns of the DB world and did her magic.

## Machine learning

- Jen: wrote all functions in ml_functions.py (see documentation) to carry out the functionality of the model using queries from the database
  - Co-wrote Application_Script.ipynb with Lavanya, which served to integrate the parsing, database, and machine learning components
  - Helped write icd9_group function in parsing_icd9
  - Set up meetings and enforced deadlines to help the project move forward

## Interface

- Akashya: Did a great visualization and demo of

- Chrysostomos: how COOL 

- James: we and our deliverables are. 

# That's right.
